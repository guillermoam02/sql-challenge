  <h1>Guillermo A M - SQL Challenge</h1>
  <hr/>

    <p>Background and project started like this:</p>
    <p>It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Data Modeling: Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. </li>
        <li>Data Engineering: Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files and import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.</li>
        <li>Data Analysis: </li>
        <ol type="A">
            <li>List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary</li>
            <li>List employees who were hired in 1986</li>
            <li>List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates</li>
            <li>List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name</li>
            <li>List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B"</li>
            <li>List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name</li>
            <li>List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name</li>
            <li>In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
